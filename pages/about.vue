Coming from my home country of Korea, where spring semester marks the beginning of the academic year, I embarked on a semester abroad as an exchange student during my third year, first semester.</p><p> This page is dedicated to documenting my journey focused on experiencing new places.</p><p> I didn't know what kind of school NU was, what kind of city Washington was, or the kind of people I would meet, but I was about to find out.</p><p> These were the precious connections I couldn't have imagined. </p><p>Let me capture them briefly here.</p>
