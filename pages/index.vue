            <p class="mb-4">The spring semester of 2024 will always stand out as the most memorable time for me. Coming from my home country of Korea, where spring semester marks the beginning of the academic year, I embarked on a semester abroad as an exchange student during my third year, first semester. This page is dedicated to documenting my journey focused on experiencing new places. I did not know what kind of school NU was, what kind of city Washington was, or the kind of people I would meet, but I was about to find out. These were the precious connections I couldn't have imagined. Let me capture them briefly here.</p>
